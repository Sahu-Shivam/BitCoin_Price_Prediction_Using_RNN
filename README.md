# BitCoin Price Prediction Using RNN
Goal of this project is to predict Bitcoin prices with help of Bitcoin historical data from January 2017 to December 2020.
There are 6 different iterations with different combinations and methods to get the best results. I have used Keras-Tuner as well for hyper-parameter tuning for some models to get best results and was able to observe changes as soon as I implemented the tuner.
